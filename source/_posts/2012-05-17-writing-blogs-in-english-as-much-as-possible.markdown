Recently I have been using stackoverflow and other awesome stuff in github.com, all of  which are in English, though many of them are created or maintained by non native English talented people.Even software blogs are written in English, but the author is French or Other Europe countries. Furthermore a Chinese famous developer pluskid contributes his opensource work in English, making the project international and active. These all encourage me to make my stuff international no matter how tiny it is.A project in English has more possibility to make it spread widely.So I will try to write blog and code in English as much as possible from now on.Well, for something important and valuable will publish both in Chinese and in English :-)
