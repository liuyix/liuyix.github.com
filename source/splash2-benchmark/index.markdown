## SPLASH-2 Benchmark

SPLASH-2 Benchmark is widely used in computer architecture research for a very long time (since 1990s). It is relatively small and short comparing fashionable benchmark such as PARSEC. So it is still very handy for evaluating some idea at the very beginning as well as for some complicated cycle accurate simulation.  
Unfortunately SPLASH-2 original homepage has been down for a while and there only exists a broken compressed source package on the web. It really upsets newbies like me in this research area.   
Therefore I downloaded the original source code and patched it using the patch released by CAPSL (website beblow) to fix some bugs and put the code on the github.
